npm init -y
- initializes a new Node.js project with default package.json file.
- package.json stores project info (name, version, dependencies, scripts, etc.).
- The -y flag skips manual input and uses default values (automatically answers yes to all prompts).

npm install express mongoose dotenv cors cookie-parser

Package Explanations:
1. express
- Node.js framework for building webservers and REST APIs.
- Handles HTTP requests and routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Lets us add middleware for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, error handling.

2. mongoose
- An Object Data Modeling library for MongoDB.
- Provides schemas to define data structure, validation and relationships.
- Simplifies CRUD operations with methods like .find(), .create(), updateOne().
- Supports middleware/hooks to run code like hashing passwords before saving.

3. dotenv
- Loads enviroment variables from a .env file into current node process (process.env).
- Keeps sensitive informations (DB URI, JWT secrets) out of source code.
- Allows different configurations for development, staging, and production.

4. cors
- Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
- Browsers block requests from a frontend domain that's different from the backend (same-origin policy).
- CORS allows selected domains (origins) to call our backend safely.

5. cookie-parser
- Parses cookies attached to HTTP requests.
- Essential for reading HTTP-only cookies which are more secure than storing JWTs in localStorage.
- Lets the server read and validate tokens stored in cookies.

6. bcryptjs
- A password-hashing library.
- bcrypt hashes passwords with salt, making it extremely hard for attackers to reverse.

7. jsonwebtoken
- Library for creating and verifying JWTs (JSON Web Tokens).
- JWTs allow stateless authentication (no server session storage needed).
- Contains encoded user info (id, role) and is signed to prevent tampering.

8. express-rate-limit
- Middleware to limit the number of requests per IP.
- Prevents brute-force attacks (guessing passwords repeatedly).
- Limits DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks.

9. helmet
- Security middleware for HTTP headers.
- Sets headers like:
  - X-Content-Type-Options -> prevent MIME sniffing
  - X-Frame-Options -> prevent clickjacking
  - Content-Security-Policy -> mitigate XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks

10. csurf
- CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection middleware.
- CSRF occurs when a malicious site tricks a logged-in user into performing actions on our site.
- cusrf ensures a token must be present and valid in requests that modify data.

11. validator
- String validation and sanitization library.
- Ensures email, URLs, or usernames are valid.
- Sanitizes input to remove malicious scripts.

12. morgan
- HTTP request logger middleware.
- Logs all incoming requests in dev console: method, URL, status, response time.
- Helps debugging API calls and checking traffic patterns.

13. nodemon
- Automatically restarts Node.js server when a change is made.
- Speeds up development.
- No need to manually restart server after every edits.

14. eslint
- Static code analysis and linting tool.
- Enforces coding standards.
- Detects potential errors (e.g. undefined variables, unused imports).
